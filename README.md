# Internet-usage-clustering
# 🌐 Internet Usage Clustering

This Python-based **Machine Learning** project clusters users based on their internet usage patterns, such as:
- Device usage time
- Frequency of visits to various site categories (e.g., social media, shopping, news)

The goal is to identify natural groupings of users for better personalization and targeted services.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Clustering users based on internet usage patterns  
✅ Optimal number of clusters determined using the **Elbow Method**  
✅ **KMeans clustering** to segment users  
✅ Data preprocessing including scaling and handling missing values  
✅ Visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**  
✅ Interpretability with pair plots and cluster visualization

## 🛠 Installation
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Internet-Usage-Clustering.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd Internet-Usage-Clustering
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
📌 Usage
Ensure your dataset (internet_usage.csv) is in the project directory.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python clustering.py
You can:

See the output of clustered users.

View visualizations of the clusters.

Analyze clustering results.

💻 Code Overview
🧹 Data Preprocessing
python
Copy code
df = df.dropna(subset=["device_usage_time_hours", "news_sites_visited", "social_media_visits", "shopping_sites_visited"])
X = df[["device_usage_time_hours", "news_sites_visited", "social_media_visits", "shopping_sites_visited"]]
Cleans the dataset by removing missing values and prepares the features for clustering.

🔄 Scaling Features
python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
Standardizes the feature values to make sure they are on the same scale.

🤖 KMeans Clustering
python
Copy code
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
Uses KMeans clustering to divide users into distinct groups based on their internet usage behavior.

📈 Evaluation Metrics
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.pairplot(df, hue="cluster")
plt.show()
Visualizes the clusters using pair plots to see the relationships between features and clusters.

🔮 Real-Time Prediction
python
Copy code
user_input = input("Enter your internet usage pattern (e.g., hours spent on social media): ")
predicted_cluster = kmeans.predict([user_input])
print(f"Predicted Cluster: {predicted_cluster}")
Test the classifier live by entering a new user's data to predict their cluster.

🌟 Example Output
✅ Cluster Prediction Example
bash
Copy code
Enter your internet usage pattern (e.g., hours spent on social media): [3, 10, 20]
Predicted Cluster: [2]
📊 Evaluation Example
plaintext
Copy code
Cluster 0:
  Average Device Usage Time: 1.5 hours
  Frequent site categories: Social Media, News

Cluster 1:
  Average Device Usage Time: 5 hours
  Frequent site categories: Shopping, Social Media

Cluster 2:
  Average Device Usage Time: 2 hours
  Frequent site categories: News, Social Media

### Changes made for your project:
- Replaced the **Customer Support Case Type Classification** content with your **Internet Usage Clustering** specifics.
- The instructions, code overview, and example outputs now reflect your clustering project.
  
### Customization:
- Update `YourUsername` with your GitHub username.
- Make sure to adjust the **dataset column names** (like `device_usage_time_hours`, `news_sites_visited`, etc.) to match those in your actual dataset.
- Modify the example outputs or add additional descriptions if needed.
